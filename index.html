            Hi, I'm OlaOcha O. Chinue, and I'm thrilled to embark on my journey in web development. Currently residing in Macon, GA, I am a proud student at <a href="https://www.mercer.edu/">Mercer University</a>, embracing the challenges and opportunities that come with pursuing my bachelor's degree in Software Development and Human Computer Interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            This web development class marks my initial steps into the vast world of software development and human-computer interaction. It's not just about learning to code; it's about crafting seamless user experiences and bringing ideas to life through technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a Mercer Bear, I'm proud to be part of a community that fosters academic growth and encourages exploration. I'm excited to share my progress and experiences with you as I navigate through the exciting realm of HTML, CSS, and beyond.
